EXAMPLE 5: SOLUTE TRANSPORT IN A LAYERED SOIL
*********************************************

In this example, transport of a non reacting, non decaying solute will be simu-
lated using the one-region convection dispersion equation, subjected to a sta-
tionary upper and lower boundary condition.

1) Edit the soldata.in file and answer the following questions:
   - What's the chemical diffusion coefficient adopted in this example?
   - What's the adopted hydrodynamic dispersivity?

2) Run WAVE

3) Edit SOL_SUM1.OUT and answer the following questions:
   - What's the mass balance error made on the solute balance for the complete
     soil profile and for the ISD compartment?
   - Is the calculated leaching after 10 days substantial?
   - Where is the mass of the peak situated in the soil profile?

4) Edit SOL_CUM1.OUT and answer the following questions:
   - What's the cumulative solute inflow?

5) Combine CONC1.OUT and WC.OUT to calculate the time course of the solute 
   concentrations in the soil solution.
