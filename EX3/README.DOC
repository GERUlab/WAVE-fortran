EXAMPLE 3 : SIMULATION OF THE WATER BALANCE IN A CROPPED SOIL
**************************************************************

In this numerical experiment, the water balance of a cropped soil is going
to be simulated, without using the universal crop growth model SUCROS.
Therefore, the plant specific items in watdata.in need to be filled out.

1) Edit the WATDATA.IN file and answer the following questions.
   - How is the time course of the Kc-factor relating potential reference evap-
     transpiration to potential crop evapotranspiration.
   - When is the leaf area index maximal of the crop?
   - What's the maximum rooting depth of the crop?
   - What's the maximum root water extraction rate of the crop and at what
     depth is it situated?

2) Run WAVE by typing [path]wave (enter).

3) Analyse in detail the output file WAT_SUM.OUT and answer the following ques-
   tions:
   - What's the integrated crop transpiration at the end of the simulation pe-
     riod?
   - Did any water stress occur during the growing season.
4) Incorporate the WAT_ET.OUT in a spreadsheet programme and analyse in detail
   the time course of the actual transpiration , potential transpiration, ac-
   tual evaporation and potential evaporation rate.
