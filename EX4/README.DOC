EXAMPLE 4 : SIMULATING THE SOIL WATER BALANCE AND CROP GROWTH IN A SOIL
CROPPED WITH WINTER WHEAT.
***********************************************************************

In this example the soil water balance is modelled together with the crop
growth using the SUCROS model.

1) Edit the cropdata.in file and answer the following questions:
   - What's the planting density of the winter wheat crop?
   - What's the specific leaf area of the crop?
   - At which leaf area value starts reduction of LAI growth rate caused
     by self shading senescence?

2) Run WAVE

3) Edit the WAT_ET.OUT file and answer the following questions:
   - What's the cumulative actual transpiration rate of the crop?
   - When did the crop attain its maximal leaf area index?

4) Edit the CROP_GRO.OUT file and answer the following questions:
   - When did the crop flower? (DVS=1?)
   - What's the dry matter production of the leaves, stems, roots, and 
     storage organs at the end of the growing season?

5) Edit the CROP_DEV.OUT file and answer the following questions:
   - Did water stress occur during the grwoing season?
