\chapter{Acknowledgements}
The authors like to express their appreciation to the different doctoral students that have been working at the Institute for Land and Water Management (formerly called the Laboratory of Soil and Water Engineering) over the past 16 years on aspects of the field water balance and the modelling of the behaviour of water and agrochemicals in soils and shallow aquifers. We are aware that the information on modelling and model input and parameters provided in this reference and user's manual are the result of the material published in 12 dissertations, in the period 1979-1994 [Belmans, 1979; Ragab, 1982; Raes, 1982; Badji, 1984; Michels, 1984; Farshi, 1986; Vereecken, 1988; Kihupi, 1990; Singh, 1990; Xevi, 1992; Kim, 1992; and Diels, 1994]. The authors, of course, also recognize the contribution of the present generation of doctoral students [Christiaens, Hubrechts, Mallants, Gonzalez, Meddahi, Mulonga, Sewnandan, and Vanderborght] exploring new numerical and experimental facets of the processes controlling the transfer and transformation of agrochemicals in the vadose environment. Those days, the PhD-staff of the Institute pays particular emphasis to the mathematical description of the soil heterogeneity, the macropore structure in soils, the transport through macropores and cracks, chemical and biological processes, and aspects related to methods for estimating the value of parameters at different scales, model calibration and validation procedures.\\

We are also grateful for having had the opportunity of working with the many dedicated and enthusiastic undergraduate students of the Institute who have given so much of their time and talents in exploring and testing the present programme code of the WAVE-model.\\

The authors are especially grateful to the Institute for Land and Water Management for promoting this project and making this publication possible by defraying the costs of its development. Special appreciation goes to the Belgian Institute for Encouragement of Scientific Research in Agriculture and Industry (I.W.O.N.L.) and the Directorates General VI (DG for Agriculture) and XII (DG for Science, Research and Development) of the European Union for making available the funds to conduct research in this domain, and making it possible to collaborate with the international scientific community.\\
