EXAMPLE 1: INFILTRATION EXPERIMENT
**********************************

In this example, we simulate an infiltration experiment for the following si-
tuation:
- Soil with 5 horizons (0-220 cm);
- Water table at a constant depth of 2 meter;
- Initially, the moisture content profile is in equilibrium with the ground wa-
  ter table (hydraulic head is constant, no flow);
- for a period of 10 days, the soil is irrigated with 10 mm/day.

In the following, some notes explain how to do run WAVE for this example.

STEP 1
------
For the WAVE program, the input files should always have the following stan-
dard names:

      GENDATA.IN      (general input data)
      WATDATA.IN      (specific data for field water balance)
      CLIMDATA.IN     (weather data)

The three files for this example are already available on the directory a:\
ex\ex1.

STEP 2
------
Next run wave by typing '"path"\WAVE'+ enter  (do this in the same directory 
as the one containing the input files), where "path" equals the path where the
wave program is copied. 

e.g. If the executable program a:\program\wave.exe was copied to c:\wave\pro-
     gram\wave.exe, and your input data are in c:\wave\ex\ex1\, then redirect
     to c:\wave\ex\ex1 and type "..\..\program\wave" (enter).

If an error occurs, you will get error messages in the file ERR_FILE

If everything is OK, you get 6 output files:
  WAT_ET.OUT  : actual and potential evapotranspiration
  WC.OUT      : water contents
  WAT_CUM.OUT : cumulative values for terms of water balance
  PH.OUT      : pressure heads
  WAT_SUM.OUT : summary table of terms of water balance
  FLX.OUT     : water fluxes

The input is repeated in the *.RES files. Look at these *.RES files to verify
if the input was correctly interpreted by the model.


STEP 3
------
Take a brief look at the input files, and answer the following question:
  How many nodes did we take to simulate this situation?

STEP 4
------
Take a look at the output files, and answer the following questions:
1.How many time steps were necessary for this 10 days experiment?
  (hint: check end of file WAT_SUM.OUT)
2.What is the simulated change in water storage for the whole profile, 
  counted over the 10 days period? 
  (hint: look at the water balance terms in file WAT_SUM.OUT)
3.How much run-off did we get in this experiment?
4.After how many days did we get steady state?
  (hint: make a graph of the water contents versus time.  
  Do this by taking the simulated water contents in file WC.OUT, 
  and loading them in a spreadsheet.
