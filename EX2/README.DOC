EXAMPLE 2 : SIMULATION OF THE WATER BALANCE IN A BARE FIELD
***********************************************************

In this numerical experiment, the water balance is simulated for a bare field
soil subjected to a varying climatic boundary conditions.The soil is draining 
freely.

1) Analyse in detail the input files, i.e.
   - analyse the climatic data by incorporating the climdata.in file
     in a spreadsheet, and try to depict the the time course of the 
     precipitation, irrigation, potential evapotranspiration, etc...
   - Analyse the year totals of the climatic data.
   - Analyse the hydraulic properties using the same procedure.

2) Run the model by typing [path]\WAVE (+enter)

3) Analyse
   1) The terms of the field water balance at the end of the simulation
      period by investigating WAT_SUM.OUT.
   2) Analyse the daily terms of the water balance by analysing
      WAT_CUM.OUT
   3) Analyse the time course of the moisture content and pressure head using
      WC.OUT and PH.OUT.
   
4) Try to answer the following question.
  1) What's the estimate of the drainage at 30 cm, 50 cm , 100 cm and 120 cm
     depth at different times?
